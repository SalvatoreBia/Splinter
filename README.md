# Splinter

A simple tool to split audio tracks into components, with the help of demucs.

## Installation

In order to generate the executable for Splinter, you need to run the `build.bat` script as administrator (**Make sure** to run it in the project folder). This is important since it will be needed to update the environment variables. 

## NOTE
Right now the application is able to split tracks in `.mp3` format.
