# Splinter

A simple, open-source tool to split audio tracks into components, with the help of demucs.

## Installation

In order to generate the executable for Splinter, you need to run the `build.bat` script as administrator (**Make sure** to run it in the project folder). This is important since it will install ffmpeg to your system and update the enviroment variables.
